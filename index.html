      <h2>The Life Before He Became Famous.</h2>
      <p>
        In His Early Days, He Was The Most Useless Man In His Family. He Used To
        Spend His Day Sitting Ideal In The Garden. And Then, One Day His Fate
        And Destiny Changed.

        <h2>The Fall.</h2>
        <p>
          One Fine Day, As Usual He Was Wasting All His Time Sitting In Garden.
          But This Was The First Time When He Decided To Do An Experiment. Every
          Day He Used To Sit On The Bench, But This Time He Sat Under A
          Tree.(Yes I Am Talking About That Evil Apple TreeðŸ˜ˆ.) Now Days And
          Days Passed, And He Used To Enjoy Sitting Under The Tree. But The Tree
          Was Started Getting Angry. But How Could Newton Know That The Tree Is
          Angry? So As A Sign, The Tree Threw An Apple At Him. Now This Time He
          Started To Think That Why Did The Apple Fall?? I Don't Know Why He
          Didn't Think That All The Other Apples Are Still Hanging And Only This
          One Fall?(You All Know The Answer As I Already Told You That The Tree
          Threw This One At Him.) Or Anything Else Like Why He Didn't Think That
          Birds Are Flying Despite The Gravity!!! Wait...What Did I Just Say?ðŸ¤”
          <br />But This Apple Changed The Whole Life, Of 21<sup>st</sup>
          Century Students(What Did You Think??)

        <h2>The Habit Of Poking Nose.</h2>
        <p>
          Physics Was Not The Only Subject Where He Tortured Students With His
          Discoveries, He Started To Poke His Nose In Mathematics And Has His
          Contributions In The Most Horrifying Topic of All Times- Calculus. He
          Will Never Let Us Study In Peace. All His Contributions Will
          Eventually Lead Us Pulling Our Hair Out.

    <div class="Conclusion">
      <img class="Einstein" src="Images/Ephoto.png" alt="Einstein" />
      <p>
        In The End, We All Know That Newton Was Really A Genius. His Laws Of
        Motion Still Defines Most Of The Physics And Was Truly The First Person
        Who Revolutionized Physics Followed By My Favourite, Albert Einstein.
